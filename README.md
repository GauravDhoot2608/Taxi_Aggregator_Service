# Taxi_Aggregator_Service
* Nowadays services like Ola and Uber have become very popular. These services aggregate the services of a group of drivers who offer their cars as taxis through the platform provided by the company. One feature that makes these services particularly attractive is that their apps inform you of the time it will take for the nearest taxi to reach your current location. 
* In this assignment we will investigate the software structure required to support this kind of service on the data structures aspect.
* Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for calculating shortest route and Edge List to develop the map with multiple points.
